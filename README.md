# Markdown to PDF Report

## Pandoc usage

### pre-requisite (brew)

-   pandoc
-   pandoc-crossref
-   mactex (if you installed basictex, you may need to remove it and install mactex)

### command

```bash {.numberLines startFrom="1"}
pandoc test.md -o output_file.pdf \
    --filter pandoc-crossref \
    --citeproc \
    --bibliography=bib.bib \
    --highlight-style=tango
```

-   `--filter pandoc-crossref` enables cross-referencing for figures, tables, and equations.
-   `--citeproc` enables citation processing for references. (only when use .bib file reference)
-   `--bibliography=bib_file.bib` specifies the bibliography file to use for references. (only when use .bib file reference)
-   `--highlight-style=tango` sets the syntax highlighting style for code blocks. You can choose from various styles like `pygments`, `kate`, `monochrome`, etc.

## Syntax of Markdown for Better Writing

### Definition

Term 1

: Definition
with lazy continuation.

    Paragraph for Term 1 definition.

    { some code, part of definition }

    - bullet 1
    - bullet 2

### Example

#### examples with (@)

(@) My first example will be numbered (1).
(@) My second example will be numbered (2).

Some text between examples.

(@) My third example will be numbered (3).

#### examples with (\@foo)

(@foo) My first example will be numbered (4).

As you can see, in the (@foo) examples, the numbering is continuous. You can also refer to them like this: (\@foo).

### list division

You can divide lists (reset ordering number and line spacing) by adding an empty line between them:

```markdown
1.  one
2.  two
3.  three

<!-- -->

1.  uno
2.  dos
3.  tres
```

upper list will be rendered as:

1.  one
2.  two
3.  three

<!-- -->

1.  uno
2.  dos
3.  tres

### Highlight

You can highlight text by

```markdown
[text to highlight]{.mark}
```

this is rendered as:

[text to highlight]{.mark}

### Small caps

You can use small caps by

```markdown
[small cap text]{.smallcaps}
```

this is rendered as:

[small cap text]{.smallcaps}

### Footnote

You can add a footnote like this:

```markdown
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.
```

this is rendered as:

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

### Code formatting

You can put line number in the code:

````
```py {.numberLines startFrom="1"}
some code
```

````

this is rendered as:

```c {.numberLines startFrom="1"}
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return x**2
```

you can also chane the color scheme of highlighting by pandoc option:

```bash {.numberLines startFrom="1"}
--highlight-style=tango
```

compatiable color schemes are:

-   pygments
-   kate
-   monochrome
-   espresso
-   zenburn
-   haddock
-   tango
-   breezedark
-   breezelight

### Image resizing

![test image](./test_image.png){width=80%}

```markdown
![test image](./test_image.png){width=80%}
```

You can resize the image by adding `{width=value}` after the image link. The value can be in percentage or in pixel.

Here’s a detailed explanation for each component of the metadata you’ve provided for your Pandoc markdown:

### reference using .bib file

You can add references using a `.bib` file. For example, you can add a reference like this:

```markdown
-   Some senetence that use reference 1. [@knuth1997art]
-   Some senetence that use reference 2. [@website]
```

`bib_file.bib` looks like this:

```bib {.numberLines startFrom="1"}
@book{knuth1997art,
  title={The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms},
  author={Knuth, Donald E.},
  year={1997},
  publisher={Addison-Wesley},
  edition={3rd},
  address={Boston},
}

@article{lamport1986document,
  title={Document preparation system: {L}a{T}e{X}},
  author={Lamport, Leslie},
  journal={Software: Practice and Experience},
  volume={16},
  number={6},
  pages={745--765},
  year={1986},
  publisher={Wiley Online Library}
}

@inproceedings{lecun1998gradient,
  title={Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition},
  author={LeCun, Yann and Bottou, L{\'e}on and Bengio, Yoshua and Haffner, Patrick},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE},
  volume={86},
  number={11},
  pages={2278--2324},
  year={1998},
  organization={IEEE}
}

@misc{website,
  author = {John Doe},
  title = {An Interesting Article},
  year = {2023},
  url = {http://www.example.com/article},
  note = {Accessed: 2024-10-10}
}
```

This will be rendered as:

-   Some senetence that use reference 1. [@knuth1997art]
-   Some senetence that use reference 2. [@website]

The references will be listed at the end of the document by using the following code block,
and only the references that are cited in the document will be displayed:

```markdown
:::{#refs}
:::
```

## Metadata for Pandoc Markdown (should be at the beginning of the markdown file)

Following is the metadata used in this document and its purpose:

```yml {.numberLines startFrom="1"}

```

### Title and Date

-   `title: Title of the Document` sets the document's title, which will appear at the top.
-   `date: \today` automatically inserts the current date when the document is compiled.

### Page Layout and Paper Size

-   `geometry: margin=1in` ensures that the margins are set to 1 inch all around.
-   `papersize: a4` specifies that the document will be printed on A4-sized paper.

### Font and Font Size

-   `fontfamily: newtxtext, newtxmath` (if uncommented) would apply the NewTX font for both text and math.
-   `fontsize: 10pt` sets the base font size to 10 points.

### Section Numbering and Equation Labels

-   `numbersections: true` enables automatic numbering for sections.
-   `autoEqnLabels: true` ensures that equations are automatically labeled for easy referencing.

### Font size

-   `\usepackage[fontsize=12pt]{scrextend}` sets the font size to 12 points.

### Custom Headers and Footers

-   `header-includes:` is a placeholder for any additional LaTeX packages or settings.
-   `\usepackage{authblk}` allows for author affiliation formatting.
-   The combination of `\pagestyle{fancy}`, `\fancyhead`, and `\fancyfoot` enables custom headers and footers. In your example:

    -   The left header (`\fancyhead[L]`) would display a course name.
    -   The right header (`\fancyhead[R]`) shows the page number.
    -   The center of the header and the footer are left empty.

### Figures and Floats

-   `\usepackage{float}` gives you control over where floating objects, like figures, are placed.
-   The `\renewenvironment{figure}` command forces all figures to stay exactly where they appear in the text by using the `H` placement specifier.

### Language Support

-   The `kotex` package (if uncommented) enables support for Korean text, while also adjusting for better spacing in both languages.

### Abstract

-   The `abstract: |` command signifies the beginning of an abstract section, which is a concise summary of the document.

If you want to elaborate or tweak specific parts of the document or need additional explanation on any section, feel free to ask!

### Spacing / new page

```markdown
\vspace{1em}
\newpage
```

-   `\vspace{1em}` adds vertical space equivalent to the height of a lowercase 'm' character.
-   `\newpage` forces a page break.
